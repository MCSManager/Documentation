## Start server

After creating the instance, navigate to the instance console and start it by clicking the 'start' button located in the top-right corner.

## ELUA

::: warning
If you do not agree to the End-User License Agreement (ELUA), you will not be able to set up your server.
:::

To start the server for the first time, you must accept the `End-User License Agreement (EULA)`. To accept ELUA, go to `configuration files`, and you will see `elua.txt`, click `edit` and select `yes`.

If you do not see this file, start your server once.
